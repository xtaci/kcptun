### QuickStart

Increase the number of open files on your server, as:

`ulimit -n 65535`, or write it in `~/.bashrc`.

Suggested `sysctl.conf` parameters for better handling of UDP packets:

```
net.core.rmem_max=26214400 // BDP - bandwidth delay product
net.core.rmem_default=26214400
net.core.wmem_max=26214400
net.core.wmem_default=26214400
net.core.netdev_max_backlog=2048 // proportional to -rcvwnd
```

You can also increase the per-socket buffer by adding parameter(default 4MB):
```
-sockbuf 16777217
```
for **slow processors**, increasing this buffer is **CRITICAL** to receive packets properly.

Download a corresponding one from precompiled [Releases](https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun/releases).

```
KCP Client: ./client_darwin_amd64 -r "KCP_SERVER_IP:4000" -l ":8388" -mode fast3 -nocomp -autoexpire 900 -sockbuf 16777217 -dscp 46
KCP Server: ./server_linux_amd64 -t "TARGET_IP:8388" -l ":4000" -mode fast3 -nocomp -sockbuf 16777217 -dscp 46
```
The above commands will establish port forwarding channel for 8388/tcp as:

> Application -> **KCP Client(8388/tcp) -> KCP Server(4000/udp)** -> Target Server(8388/tcp) 

which tunnels the original connection:

> Application -> Target Server(8388/tcp) 

### Install from source

```
$go get -u github.com/xtaci/kcptun/...
```

All precompiled releases are genereated from `build-release.sh` script.

### Basic Tuning Guide

#### Improving Thoughput

> **Q: I have a high speed network link, how to reach the maximum bandwidth?**        

> **A:** Increase `-rcvwnd` on KCP Client and `-sndwnd` on KCP Server **simultaneously & gradually**, the mininum one decides the maximum transfer rate of the link, as `wnd * mtu / rtt`; Then try downloading something and to see if it meets your requirements. 
(mtu is adjustable by `-mtu`)

#### Improving Latency

> **Q: I'm using kcptun for game, I don't want any lag happening.**    

> **A:** Lag means packet loss for most of the time, lags can be improved by changing `-mode`.

> eg: `-mode fast3`    

> Aggresiveness/Responsiveness on retransmission for embeded modes are:

> *fast3 > fast2 > fast > normal > default*

#### HOLB

Since streams are multiplexed into a single physical channel, head of line blocking may appear under certain circumstances, by
increasing `-smuxbuf` to a larger value (default 4MB) may mitigate this problem, obviously this will costs more memory.

#### Slow Devices

kcptun made use of **ReedSolomon-Codes** to recover lost packets, which requires massive amount of computation, a low-end ARM device cannot satisfy kcptun well. To unleash the full potential of kcptun, a multi-core x86 homeserver CPU like AMD Opteron is recommended.
If you insist on running under some ARM routers, you'd better turn off `FEC` and use `salsa20` as the encryption method.

#### Forward Error Correction

In coding theory, the [Reed–Solomon code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction) belongs to the class of non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes. The Reed–Solomon code is based on univariate polynomials over finite fields.

It is able to detect and correct multiple symbol errors. By adding t check symbols to the data, a Reed–Solomon code can detect any combination of up to t erroneous symbols, or correct up to ⌊t/2⌋ symbols. As an erasure code, it can correct up to t known erasures, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures. Furthermore, Reed–Solomon codes are suitable as multiple-burst bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of b + 1 consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size b. The choice of t is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within wide limits.

![FED](FEC.png)

Setting parameters of RS-Code with ```-datashard m -parityshard n``` on **BOTH** KCP Client & KCP Server **MUST** be **IDENTICAL**.

#### DSCP

Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking architecture that specifies a simple, scalable and coarse-grained mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service (QoS) on modern IP networks. DiffServ can, for example, be used to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.

DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the 8-bit differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header for packet classification purposes. The DS field and ECN field replace the outdated IPv4 TOS field.

setting each side with ```-dscp value```, Here are some [Commonly used DSCP values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services#Commonly_used_DSCP_values).

#### Cryptanalysis

kcptun is shipped with builtin packet encryption powered by various block encryption algorithms and works in [Cipher Feedback Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Feedback_(CFB)), for each packet to be sent, the encryption process will start from encrypting a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) from the [system entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random), so encryption to same plaintexts never leads to a same ciphertexts thereafter.

The contents of the packets are completely anonymous with encryption, including the headers(FEC,KCP), checksums and contents. Note that, no matter which encryption method you choose on you upper layer, if you disable encryption by specifying `-crypt none` to kcptun, the transmit will be insecure somehow, since the header is ***PLAINTEXT*** to everyone it would be susceptible to header tampering, such as jamming the *sliding window size*, *round-trip time*, *FEC property* and *checksums*. ```aes-128``` is suggested for minimal encryption since modern CPUs are shipped with [AES-NI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set) instructions and performs even better than `salsa20`(check the table below).

Other possible attacks to kcptun includes: a) [traffic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis), dataflow on specific websites may have pattern while interchanging data, but this type of eavesdropping has been mitigated by adapting [smux](https://github.com/xtaci/smux) to mix data streams so as to introduce noises, perfect solution to this has not appeared yet, theroretically by shuffling/mixing messages on larger scale network may mitigate this problem.  b) [replay attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack), since the asymmetrical encryption has not been introduced into kcptun for some reason, capturing the packets and replay them on a different machine is possible, (notice: hijacking the session and decrypting the contents is still *impossible*), so upper layers should contain a asymmetrical encryption system to guarantee the authenticity of each message(to process message exactly once), such as HTTPS/OpenSSL/LibreSSL, only by signing the requests with private keys can eliminate this type of attack. 

Important: 
1. `-crypt` and `-key` must be the same on both KCP Client & KCP Server.
2. `-crypt xor` is also insecure and vulnerable to [known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack), do not use this unless you know what you are doing. (*cryptanalysis note: any type of [counter mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_(CTR)) is insecure in packet encryption due to the shorten of counter period and leads to iv/nonce collision*)

The encrytion performance in kcptun is as fast as in openssl library(if not faster).


#### Memory Control

Routers, mobile devices are susceptible to memory consumption; by setting GOGC environment(eg: GOGC=20) will make the garbage collector to recycle faster.
Reference: https://blog.golang.org/go15gc

Primary memory allocation are done from a global buffer pool *xmit.Buf*, in kcp-go, when we need to allocate some bytes, we can get from that pool, and a *fixed-capacity* 1500 bytes(mtuLimit) will be returned, the *rx queue*, *tx queue* and *fec queue* all receive bytes from there, and they will return the bytes to the pool after using to prevent *unnecessary zer0ing* of bytes. 
The pool mechanism maintained a *high watermark* for slice objects, these *in-flight* objects from the pool will survive from the perodical garbage collection, meanwhile the pool kept the ability to return the memory to runtime if in idle, `-sndwnd`,`-rcvwnd`,`-ds`, `-ps`, these parameters affect this *high watermark*, the larger the value, the bigger the memory consumption will be.

`-smuxbuf` also affects the maximum memory consumption, this parameter maintains a subtle balance between *concurrency* and *resource*, you can increase this value(default 4MB) to boost concurrency if you have many clients to serve and you get a powerful server at the same time, and also you can decrease this value to serve only 1 or 2 clients and hope this program can run under some embeded SoC system with limited memory and only you can access. (Notice that the `-smuxbuf` value is not proprotional to concurrency, you need to test.)


#### Compression

kcptun has builtin snappy algorithms for compressing streams:

> Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
> compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead,
> it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance,
> compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster
> for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to
> 100% bigger.

> Reference: http://google.github.io/snappy/

Compression may save bandwidth for **PLAINTEXT** data, it's quite useful for specific scenarios as cross-datacenter replications, by compressing the redologs in dbms or kafka-like message queues and then transfer the data streams across the continent can be much faster.

Compression is enabled by default, you can disable it by setting ```-nocomp``` on **BOTH** KCP Client & KCP Server **MUST** be **IDENTICAL**.

#### SNMP

```go
// Snmp defines network statistics indicator
type Snmp struct {
    BytesSent        uint64 // raw bytes sent
    BytesReceived    uint64
    MaxConn          uint64
    ActiveOpens      uint64
    PassiveOpens     uint64
    CurrEstab        uint64 // count of connections for now
    InErrs           uint64 // udp read errors
    InCsumErrors     uint64 // checksum errors from CRC32
    KCPInErrors      uint64 // packet iput errors from kcp
    InSegs           uint64
    OutSegs          uint64
    InBytes          uint64 // udp bytes received
    OutBytes         uint64 // udp bytes sent
    RetransSegs      uint64
    FastRetransSegs  uint64
    EarlyRetransSegs uint64
    LostSegs         uint64 // number of segs infered as lost
    RepeatSegs       uint64 // number of segs duplicated
    FECRecovered     uint64 // correct packets recovered from FEC
    FECErrs          uint64 // incorrect packets recovered from FEC
    FECSegs          uint64 // FEC segments received
    FECShortShards   uint64 // number of data shards that's not enough for recovery
}
```

Sending a `SIGUSR1` signal to KCP Client or KCP Server will dump SNMP information to console, just like `/proc/net/snmp`. You can use this information to do fine-grained tuning.

### Manual Control

https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md#protocol-configuration

`-mode manual -nodelay 1 -interval 20 -resend 2 -nc 1`

Low-level KCP configuration can be altered by using manual mode like above, make sure you really **UNDERSTAND** what these means before doing **ANY** manual settings.


### Identical Parmeters

The parameters below **MUST** be **IDENTICAL** on **BOTH** side:

1. -key
1. -crypt
1. -nocomp
1. -datashard
1. -parityshard
